# Flashcard-Generator
Run either flashcard.js or flashcard-ex.js in node.

flashcard.js is a basic flashcard trivia program.

flashcard-ex.js allows you to create or delete flashcards to be used in flashcard.js. Due to unclear instructions, this program is defunct until further notice.

The program will then ask 10 questions from a pool at random and give a score at the end.
